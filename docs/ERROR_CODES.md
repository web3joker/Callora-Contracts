# Contract Error Codes

Stable, semantic `u32` error codes used by the GrantFox smart contracts.
These numeric discriminants are part of each contract's public interface and
must not be reassigned once released.

## Stability rules

- Preserve every existing numeric code for its current semantic meaning.
- Add new variants only with new, previously unused codes in that contract.
- Do not reuse a removed code for a different error.
- `cargo test --workspace` enforces code stability and duplicate-code checks.
